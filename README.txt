This was my attempt at hand baking a game engine in Python. I finished the engine, but not the game. Feel free to use it for whatever you like.

I'm especially proud of this one. It took me so long to get to a playable state, but I learned a lot from it. When I eventually moved on to Gamemaker Studio rather than Pygame, the whole process was easy as pie because I understood the underlying principals.

A+ would do again.
